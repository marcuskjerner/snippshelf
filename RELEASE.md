## Assignment report

_In the assignment report, you reflect on your assignment. You can write in English or Swedish._


### Reflection

_Your own thoughts on the assignment. What was hard, what have you learned? What could you have done differently?_

This was the first time I have worked with handlebars.js as a template engine. This was quite different from what I'm used to be working with. Looking back I think I should have seperated the front and backend even more, maybee even making a seperate API. This would have made working with the frontend easier and the app easier to scale later.

### Further improvments 
_Further improvements of the assignment. What could you have done, but did not have the time to complete?_

Right now I have hidden the extra features I didn't have time to implement. Such as fields for type of programmig language, and tags. I've also hidden the search field which was meant to query based on title, tags and programming language. 
Adding a sort button for the Snippets page was something I planned for to.

Will probably ad these features later in my spare time.

### Extras

_Have you done anything more than the requirements?_

The signed user can access all of their snippets by going to My Snippets.

_Feedback to the course management about the assignment._

Really fun and engaging assigment. Really usefull learning about authentication and security, especially without modules doing most of the work.
